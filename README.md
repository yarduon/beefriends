Beefriends is a simple website to help bees to find other bees to build a wonderful hive. 

As you can obviously suppose bees aren't able to build websites, but what if we help them? 

Anyway, we should be careful... We don't want them to bee-ing ruling the world... Because bees can't read, right?

How awesome are you to bee part? Bzzz...
